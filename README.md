## 🌱 Open Source Contributions - Compilers

As a compiler engineer, I strive to contribute to to the thriving open source compiler community. Here are some highlights so far, and I aim to increase my contributions as I go along:

- 🧠 [LLVM Project](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project) — Optimizations, passes, and test improvements.
- ⚙️ [XLS (Google)](https://github.com/google/xls) — Compiler infrastructure for hardware synthesis.
- 📊 [Polly](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/tree/main/polly) — High-level loop and data-locality optimizations.
- 🧪 My [personal experiments and tools](https://github.com/ericxu233?tab=repositories&q=&type=source&language=&sort=stargazers)

_Tracking progress, improving performance, and pushing the boundaries of compilers._
