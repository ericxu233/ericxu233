## ðŸŒ± Open Source Contributions - Compilers

As a compiler engineer, I strive to contribute to the thriving open source compiler community. Here are some highlights so far, and I aim to increase my contributions as I go along:

- [LLVM Project](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project) â€” 1 commit https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/commits/main/?author=ericxu233
- [XLS (Google)](https://github.com/google/xls) â€” 
- [FPGA runtime for OpenCL](https://github.com/intel/fpga-runtime-for-opencl) â€” 5 commits https://github.com/intel/fpga-runtime-for-opencl/commits/main/?author=ericxu233

_Tracking progress, improving performance, and pushing the boundaries of compilers._
